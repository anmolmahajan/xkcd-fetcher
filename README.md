# xkcd-fetcher
Meh. I was bored.

# Dependencies

xkcd.py requires the following libraries:

1. json
 
2. urllib, urllib2

3. sys

These should be preinstalled in most systems.


In addition to the libraries required by xkcd.py, xkcdgui.py requires the tk and Tkinter libraries. 



# Usage

In your terminal, type
    
    chmod +x xkcd.py
    ./xkcd.py <number>
    
    
To use the GUI script, first install the tk library for python and then run

    chmod +x xkcdgui.py
    ./xkcdgui.py <number>

Leave \<number\> blank to get the latest comic or enter any number to get that comic.
