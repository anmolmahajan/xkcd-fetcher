# xkcd-fetcher
Meh. I was bored.

# Dependencies

xkcd.py requires the following libraries:

1. json
 
2. urllib, urllib2

3. sys

These should be preinstalled in most systems.


In addition to the libraries required by xkcd.py, xkcdgui.py requires the tk and Tkinter libraries. 



# Usage

#CLI

In your terminal, type
    
    chmod +x xkcd.py
    ./xkcd.py <number>
    
    

# GUI

To use the GUI script, first install the tk library for python and then run

    chmod +x xkcdgui.py
    ./xkcdgui.py <number>

Leave \<number\> blank to get the latest comic or enter any number to get that comic.

And press the left and right arrow keys to go back or forward or press ESC to exit.
